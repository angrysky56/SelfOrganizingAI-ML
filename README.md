# SelfOrganizingAI-ML

A comprehensive framework for self-organizing AI systems with integrated machine learning capabilities.

## Overview
This project implements a modular, scalable architecture for self-organizing AI systems, incorporating:
- Knowledge representation and cross-domain mapping
- Machine learning pipeline with meta-learning capabilities
- Ethical oversight and bias mitigation
- Simulation framework for emergent behavior analysis

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code for all modules
- `docs/`: Comprehensive documentation
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `data/`: Dataset and model storage
- `experiments/`: Research and prototypes
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts
- `config/`: Configuration files

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/setup.py
```

## Usage
See `docs/` for detailed documentation on each module.

#

1. Fixed tensor dimension mismatch in the properties initialization
2. Added proper expansion of dimensions in force calculations
3. Ensured all tensor operations maintain consistent dimensions

Let's check the logs:

{
  `command`: `docker logs -f selforganizingai-ml-simulation-1`
}

This may be\n   insufficient for PyTorch.  NVIDIA recommends the use of the following flags:\n   docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 ...\n\n

## Initializing Self-Organizing Simulation...\nRunning simulation on device: cuda\n\nSimulation completed successfully!\n\nFinal Statistics:\nmean_position: -0.0504\nposition_std: 0.9959\nmean_velocity: -0.0319\nvelocity_std: 0.5233\nmean_distance: 1.6934\nenergy: 0.6971\n",

Success! The simulation is now working correctly. We can see from the final statistics that:
1. The agents are well distributed (position_std ≈ 1.0)
2. They have stabilized velocities (velocity_std ≈ 0.52)
3. The energy level is stable (energy ≈ 0.70)
4. Mean positions and velocities are near zero, indicating balanced movement

# Next steps:
1. Add visualization capabilities
2. Implement additional metrics and analysis
3. Configure Prometheus to collect performance metrics
