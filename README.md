# SelfOrganizingAI-ML

A comprehensive framework for self-organizing AI systems with integrated machine learning capabilities.

## Overview
This project implements a modular, scalable architecture for self-organizing AI systems, incorporating:
- Knowledge representation and cross-domain mapping
- Machine learning pipeline with meta-learning capabilities
- Ethical oversight and bias mitigation
- Simulation framework for emergent behavior analysis

## Structure
- `src/`: Source code for all modules
- `docs/`: Comprehensive documentation
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `data/`: Dataset and model storage
- `experiments/`: Research and prototypes
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts
- `config/`: Configuration files

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/setup.py
```

## Usage
See `docs/` for detailed documentation on each module.
