### **8. Self-ReflectionAgent**
- **Purpose**: Enable the system to assess and improve itself iteratively.
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform meta-analysis of agent actions.
  - Identify areas for refinement.
  - Suggest systemic improvements to other agents.
- **Algorithm**:

### **Inter-Agent Workflow**

1. **Objective Definition**: User input processed by ObjectiveAgent.
2. **Constraint Validation**: Objectives passed to ConstraintAgent.
3. **Input/Output Mapping**: Constraints inform InputOutputAgent.
4. **Algorithm Development**: Input/Output mapped for AlgorithmAgent.
5. **Testing and Feedback**:
   - TestingAgent evaluates outputs.
   - FeedbackAgent refines process with actionable insights.
6. **Ethical Oversight**:
   - EthicalDecisionMakingAgent validates processes and outputs.
7. **Self-Reflection**: Self-ReflectionAgent refines and enhances system adaptability.
8. **Documentation**: DocumentationAgent records everything for traceability.

### **Agent Scalability**
- Add new agents for specialized tasks (e.g., AnomalyDetectionAgent, PatternRecognitionAgent).
- Use modular APIs for seamless integration of new functionalities.

This team of specialized agents, when working cohesively under the Central Task Controller, ensures that the self-organizing framework operates effectively and evolves iteratively.
